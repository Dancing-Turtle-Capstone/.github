# Dancing Turtle

Hello! This is the official GitHub Repository for Dancing Turtle. Our code consists of multiple parts, each with their own repositories. They all designed to work togehter and each repo will have a guide on how it works and how to run it.

# To get the turtle operational and ready for guests to interact with complete the following steps in order:

1. Turn both the turtle and the communications box on.
2. Open Termius and go to the Raspi's IP (It should be a button that will open the ssh connection for you)
3. Follow the steps to run the angle movement code.
4. Then in a terminal window, follow the steps for running the angle calculation code.
6. The communications box will automatically run the GUI script on startup, so all you will need to do is open firefox and go to the pinned IP address, press function + F11 to set it to fullscreen.
7. Once it's fullscreened it's primed and ready to go! Happy dancing!
